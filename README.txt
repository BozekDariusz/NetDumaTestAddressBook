Things I didn't finish:

- UI. I was just able to create the interface for the UI but no actual interactions for users.

- Saving/Loading options. Again I just didn't have enough time to finish it.

- Processing user input. Here I would anticipate some issues with writing regex but nothing too crazy. If there was more time I would get it done. 

- Testing. I wasn't able to finish all of the functionality so I wasn't anywhere close to starting testing. 

If I had 1-2 weeks to work on it:

- Finish all functionality.

- Use unordered set for storing contacts and create own hashing function to improve adding, removing and searching for contacts. 

- Use pointers for Person and Address classes as to not overload stack when having large number of entries.

- Maybe use separate data structure for things like towns, countries and names to improve searching. Trade of memory space for speed. 

I'm not aware of any bugs as I didn't test my solution at all. I did not encounter any problems while working on my solution and the only reason I wasn't done was because of the time restriction. After all I had only four hours to finsih this test.
